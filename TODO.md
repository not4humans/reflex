# TODO: Human-Like Procedural Learning Enhancements

This document captures key improvements needed to make the Agentic Skill Compiler more aligned with how humans actually develop and use procedural skills.

## âœ… COMPLETED: Context-Aware Skill Learning (August 2025)

### Context-Sensitive Skill Learning âœ…
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED - Skills now adapt based on execution context

**What We Built**:
- Context embeddings for skill conditions (environment state, authentication, resource availability)
- Conditional skill execution based on environmental factors
- Context analysis module that extracts success/failure patterns from traces
- Multi-context skill compilation and retrieval

**Key Features Added**:
- `execution_context`, `preconditions_met`, `failure_indicators` in ToolCall model
- `success_conditions`, `context_adaptations`, `failure_patterns` in CompiledSkillMetadata
- Context-aware pattern mining and skill compilation
- Context compatibility scoring in skill retrieval
- Adaptive skill execution with real-time context assessment

**Example**: Azure deployment skill now:
- Detects authentication state and logs in if needed
- Handles network instability with retry logic
- Creates missing resource groups automatically
- Adapts execution based on 15+ context factors

## ðŸ§  Core Human Learning Principles to Implement

### 1. Skill Composition and Hierarchical Learning
**Current State**: Individual skills are atomic and can't be combined.

**Human Analogy**: Humans build complex skills from simpler ones (driving = starting car + steering + acceleration control + navigation).

**Implementation Needed**:
- Skill dependency graphs
- Automatic skill chaining for complex tasks
- Hierarchical skill compilation (micro-skills â†’ macro-skills â†’ complex workflows)

### 2. Adaptive Skill Refinement
**Current State**: Skills are static once compiled.

**Human Analogy**: Humans continuously refine skills based on outcomes (adjusting cooking technique based on taste, improving typing speed through practice).

**Implementation Needed**:
- Skill performance feedback loops
- Automatic skill parameter tuning based on execution results
- Version control for skills with performance-based selection
- Skill "muscle memory" - frequently used skills become more optimized

### 3. Emotional and Motivational Context
**Current State**: No consideration of agent "preferences" or optimization goals.

**Human Analogy**: Humans develop skills differently based on personal goals (speed vs quality, effort vs outcome).

**Implementation Needed**:
- Agent personality profiles affecting skill compilation preferences
- Multi-objective skill optimization (speed vs cost vs accuracy)
- Skill development priorities based on agent role/domain

## ðŸ”„ Procedural Learning Mechanisms

### 1. Deliberate Practice Integration
**Concept**: Skills improve through focused, repetitive practice with feedback.

**Implementation**:
- Skill practice mode: agents deliberately repeat patterns to improve performance
- Performance tracking over time for each skill
- Automatic identification of skills needing practice

### 2. Transfer Learning Between Tasks
**Current Gap**: No skill generalization across domains.

**Human Model**: Skills learned in one domain transfer to related domains (typing skills help with piano, cooking skills help with chemistry).

**Implementation**:
- Skill abstraction levels (tool-specific â†’ domain-specific â†’ general)
- Cross-domain skill matching and adaptation
- Skill analogy detection and transfer

### 3. Forgetting and Skill Decay
**Missing**: Skills should degrade without use, just like human skills.

**Implementation**:
- Skill confidence decay over time without use
- Periodic skill "refresher" execution
- Skill archival and reactivation based on usage patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Skill Development

### 1. Metacognitive Skill Learning
**Concept**: Learning how to learn skills more effectively.

**Implementation**:
- Pattern recognition for skill compilation effectiveness
- Learning optimal practice schedules for different skill types
- Self-assessment of skill competency

### 2. Social Skill Learning
**Vision**: Agents learning skills from observing other agents, not just their own traces.

**Implementation**:
- Cross-agent skill sharing and validation
- Skill reputation and recommendation systems
- Collaborative skill development

### 3. Anticipatory Skill Development
**Human Model**: Humans practice skills before they need them (fire drills, rehearsing presentations).

**Implementation**:
- Proactive skill compilation based on predicted future needs
- Skill gap analysis and recommendation
- "What-if" skill development for potential scenarios

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Priorities

### Phase 7: Context-Aware Skills (High Priority)
```python
class ContextualSkill:
    def __init__(self, base_skill, context_conditions, adaptation_rules):
        self.base_skill = base_skill
        self.context_conditions = context_conditions  # When to use this variant
        self.adaptation_rules = adaptation_rules      # How to modify execution
    
    async def execute(self, task, context):
        if self.matches_context(context):
            return await self.adapted_execute(task, context)
        else:
            return await self.base_skill.execute(task)
```

### Phase 8: Skill Composition Framework
```python
class CompositeSkill:
    def __init__(self, sub_skills, composition_strategy):
        self.sub_skills = sub_skills
        self.composition_strategy = composition_strategy  # sequential, parallel, conditional
    
    async def execute(self, task):
        return await self.composition_strategy.execute(self.sub_skills, task)
```

### Phase 9: Adaptive Learning System
```python
class AdaptiveSkillRegistry:
    def update_skill_performance(self, skill_id, execution_result):
        # Update skill parameters based on performance
        # Trigger recompilation if performance degrades
        # Suggest practice sessions for underperforming skills
```

## ðŸ§ª Research Questions to Explore

1. **Optimal Practice Schedules**: How often should skills be practiced to maintain performance?
2. **Skill Interference**: When do new skills interfere with existing ones?
3. **Context Generalization**: How broad should context patterns be for skill applicability?
4. **Performance Metrics**: What constitutes "skill mastery" for an AI agent?
5. **Skill Forgetting Curves**: How should skill confidence decay over time?

## ðŸŽ“ Human Learning Literature to Integrate

- **Motor Learning Theory**: Stages of skill acquisition (cognitive â†’ associative â†’ autonomous)
- **Deliberate Practice Research**: Ericsson's work on expert performance development  
- **Transfer Learning**: Positive and negative transfer between skills
- **Procedural Memory**: How humans store and retrieve procedural knowledge
- **Expertise Development**: Progression from novice to expert behavior patterns

## ðŸš€ Long-Term Vision

Create an AI skill learning system that exhibits human-like characteristics:
- **Gradual skill development** through practice and repetition
- **Context-sensitive adaptation** based on environmental factors
- **Hierarchical skill organization** from simple to complex
- **Cross-domain transfer** of learned patterns
- **Continuous improvement** through feedback and refinement
- **Social learning** from observing and collaborating with other agents

This would represent a fundamental advance in AI procedural learning, moving beyond static skill compilation to dynamic, adaptive, human-inspired skill development.
