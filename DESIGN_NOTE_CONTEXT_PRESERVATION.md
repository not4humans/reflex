# ðŸ§  **Design Note: Context Preservation in Skill Compilation**

## **ðŸ¤” The Context Problem We Discovered**

During our Azure deployment scenario analysis, we realized a fundamental limitation:

**Our system captures TOOL SEQUENCES but loses HUMAN CONTEXT.**

## **ðŸ§ª What Happens with Human Learning**

When humans learn a skill:

```
Human Learning Process:
1. "Try this approach" 
2. "Oh that failed because of X, let me adjust Y"
3. "Now it works, but I need to remember to always check Z"
4. "This pattern works reliably when I account for X, Y, Z"

Result: Human remembers not just the steps, but the CONDITIONS and CONTEXT
```

## **ðŸ¤– What Our System Currently Does**

```python
# What we capture:
pattern = ["azure_login", "azure_deploy"]
parameters = {"resource_group": "my-rg", "app_path": "./"}

# What we LOSE:
- Why this resource group was chosen
- What authentication method worked  
- Which errors were encountered and fixed
- Environmental conditions that made it work
- User's problem-solving decisions
```

## **ðŸ’¡ Potential Enhancement: Context Snippets**

### **Idea: Augment Skills with Learning Context**

```python
SKILL_METADATA = {
    "name": "azure_deploy_skill",
    "pattern": ["azure_login", "azure_deploy"],
    "confidence": 0.85,
    
    # NEW: Context preservation
    "learning_context": {
        "common_failures": [
            "Authentication timeout - retry with shorter intervals",
            "Resource group 'default' doesn't exist - use 'my-rg'",
            "App path must be absolute, not relative"
        ],
        "success_conditions": [
            "Works best with interactive auth method",
            "Requires resource group 'my-rg' to exist",
            "User must be logged in to Azure CLI first"
        ],
        "human_insights": [
            "User always checks resource group exists before deploying",
            "User prefers interactive auth over service principal",
            "User typically deploys from ./dist folder, not root"
        ]
    }
}
```

### **How This Could Help Validation**

```python
def _generate_contextual_inputs(self, metadata):
    """Generate test inputs informed by human learning context."""
    
    context = metadata.get("learning_context", {})
    success_conditions = context.get("success_conditions", [])
    
    # Use context to generate more realistic test inputs
    if "resource group 'my-rg'" in str(success_conditions):
        test_args["resource_group"] = "my-rg"  # Use learned value
    if "interactive auth" in str(success_conditions):
        test_args["auth_method"] = "interactive"  # Use learned method
    
    return test_args
```

### **Implementation Ideas**

1. **Capture Failure Context**
   ```python
   # During trace collection, also capture:
   - Failed attempts before success
   - Error messages and resolutions
   - User corrections and adjustments
   ```

2. **Semantic Context Storage**
   ```python
   # Store not just parameters, but WHY they work:
   "parameter_rationale": {
       "resource_group": "my-rg because default doesn't exist",
       "auth_method": "interactive because service principal not configured"
   }
   ```

3. **Human Annotation Integration**
   ```python
   # Allow users to add context when patterns are detected:
   "This works because I always make sure the resource group exists first"
   "Remember to authenticate to Azure CLI before running this"
   ```

## **ðŸŽ¯ Why This Matters**

**Without context, skills are brittle.**
**With context, skills become more human-like and reliable.**

This enhancement could bridge the gap between **"remembering sequences"** and **"understanding why sequences work"** - making our compiled skills much more robust and realistic.

*Note: This is a design consideration for future enhancement. Current Phase 5 validation works well for simple tools, but complex scenarios like Azure deployment reveal the need for context preservation.*
