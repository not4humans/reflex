You’re right to be skeptical. The way to beat “big plan syndrome” is to ship a walking skeleton and hard-gate each addition with observable tests. Below is a step-by-step implementation plan that keeps you in tight control, proves value early, and prevents context drift.

I’m giving you: (1) principles, (2) milestones with clear exit criteria, (3) demos you can run at each step, (4) tests/metrics to validate, (5) tripwires to stop scope creep. You can copy this into your tracker as your dev plan.

⸻

Guiding principles (we hold these every day)
	•	Walking skeleton first: run end-to-end with the fewest moving parts, then add muscles.
	•	One new variable per step: add exactly one capability at a time; if it breaks, we know where.
	•	Determinism over cleverness: pin everything (prompts, temps, versions). If we can’t replay it, we don’t ship it.
	•	Always demoable: each milestone ends with a runnable demo and visible logs, not just unit tests.
	•	Stop rules: if the milestone’s exit criteria aren’t met, don’t start the next one.

Milestone 0 — “Hello Reflex” walking skeleton (1–2 days)

Scope
	•	Reflex.wrap(agent, tools, llm_client) returns a ProxyAgent that:
	•	Creates a ReflexSession per .run().
	•	Injects a fixed string into the first LLM request: "REFLEX: skills not loaded (skeleton)."
	•	Parses <SKILL_PROPOSE> in the reply but does nothing (logs only).
	•	ToolProxy logs start/stop (no retries, no timeouts yet).
	•	Single JSONL log file with trace_id.

Demo

wrapped = reflex.wrap(agent=my_agent, tools=[echo], llm_client=openai_chat)
wrapped.run("Say hi")
# Check logs: session started, bulletin injected once, LLM reply parsed.

Exit criteria
	•	Exactly one injection per turn (prove with two LLM calls in a loop).
	•	Logs readable; every event carries the same trace_id.

Tripwires
	•	No manifest parsing. No gate. No executors.

⸻

Milestone 1 — Agent–Skill Protocol (ASP) + Skill Cards (3–4 days)

Scope
	•	Implement Skill Bulletin with hardcoded 1–2 fake Skill Cards (no registry yet).
	•	Implement ASP parser: extract <SKILL_PROPOSE> / <CLARIFY>, validate JSON schema, reject malformed.
	•	On valid propose, echo back a deterministic <SKILL_RESULT> (no execution)—just to prove the loop.

Demo
	•	Prompt the LLM with the injected card text and ask it to propose.
	•	See a <SKILL_RESULT> appear in the conversation and in logs.

Tests
	•	Parser rejects malformed blocks.
	•	Bulletin injected once; <SKILL_RESULT> inserted once.

Exit criteria
	•	End-to-end “propose → confirm → result message” loop works with zero business logic.

Tripwires
	•	No scoring, no preconditions, no policies yet.

⸻

Milestone 2 — Minimal Gate (compat + preconditions only) (3–5 days)

Scope
	•	Introduce Capability Manifest v0 with just:
	•	id, compat, signature.inputs/outputs, preconditions (slots present, simple invariants).
	•	plan.steps: but steps still no-op (we’ll execute in the next milestone).
	•	Gate runs compat → preconditions only. If pass → return <SKILL_CONFIRM>, else <SKILL_REJECT> with reasons.
	•	Blackboard: accept an explicit blackboard={}; auto-seed returns {ctx:{}, env:{}, work:{}} for now (just to pass through).

Demo
	•	Manifest for a trivial capability: ensure_markdown_title (input: file_path).
	•	LLM proposes with/without file_path. Verify Gate behavior.

Tests
	•	Compat mismatches block proposals.
	•	Missing required slots trigger clarify (generated from signature.inputs).

Exit criteria
	•	Deterministic accept/reject with human-readable reasons.

Tripwires
	•	Do not add scoring or policy yet. Keep it boring.

⸻

Milestone 3 — PlanRunner + ToolProxy execution (5–7 days)

Scope
	•	Implement PlanRunner:
	•	Sequential steps; each step calls a wrapped tool.
	•	Support timeout_ms, guard if prev.ok, and one idempotence_key string.
	•	Support result_map to fill manifest outputs.
	•	Implement ToolProxy:
	•	Time the call, log args/results (with redaction placeholders), raise on timeout.
	•	No retries yet.
	•	Return a real <SKILL_RESULT> with outputs.

Demo
	•	Capability: ensure_header that uses a dummy fs tool to add # Title to a file if missing.
	•	LLM proposes, Gate approves, PlanRunner patches a temp file, returns success; re-run shows idempotence.

Tests
	•	Step guard works.
	•	Timeout triggers error.
	•	Idempotence short-circuits the second run.

Exit criteria
	•	A plan can change the world deterministically and report outputs; re-running is safe.

Tripwires
	•	Still avoid scoring/policy; avoid compensation (add next).

⸻

Milestone 4 — Activation scoring + single τ + Clarify path (3–4 days)

Scope
	•	Add activation to manifest:
	•	required_slots, goal_labels, keywords_any, score_weights, tau, cooldown_s.
	•	Gate now runs: compat → preconditions → score ≥ τ.
	•	Implement Clarify path:
	•	If required_slots missing and a pinned parser exists → call LLM at T=0; else return a specific question for the user.

Demo
	•	Provide user text “deploy to staging”; bulletin shows deploy skill; LLM proposes; Gate uses labels to reach τ.

Tests
	•	Scoring is monotonic and explainable: log each component and final score.
	•	Cooldown prevents loops.

Exit criteria
	•	“Skill temperature” (τ) clearly controls eagerness; Clarify questions are crisp and derived from inputs.

Tripwires
	•	Don’t add policy yet. Don’t query the network during preconditions.

⸻

Milestone 5 — Budgets, compensation, and replay (5–7 days)

Scope
	•	In plan: enforce budget (max cost/latency). Abort and run compensation on partial_failure.
	•	Implement append-only event sink (JSONL/Parquet) with a single trace_id.
	•	Implement replay(trace_id) that re-executes Gate + PlanRunner with pinned manifest & blackboard snapshot; compares decisions & outputs.

Demo
	•	Capability with a step that intentionally fails; see compensation run; replay shows identical decisions.

Tests
	•	Cost/latency budget exceeded → abort with compensation.
	•	Replay decision parity = 100% on golden traces.

Exit criteria
	•	You can prove determinism with a replay—this is the product’s credibility.

Tripwires
	•	If replay parity <100%, stop and fix before proceeding.

⸻

Milestone 6 — Blackboard auto-seeding + parsers at T=0 (3–5 days)

Scope
	•	Implement seeders: skills.yaml → framework state (adapter) → env probe → caller hints.
	•	Log blackboard_seed with sources.
	•	Implement parsers (same LLM at T=0), pinned prompt refs, unit tests.

Demo
	•	No blackboard passed; seeding reads skills.yaml with ctx.repo, ctx.cloud.
	•	Parser extracts app_name from README; Gate accepts.

Tests
	•	Seeding does not hit network; replays use the snapshot, not reseeding.
	•	Parser tests are deterministic across runs.

Exit criteria
	•	One-liner wrapped.run("…") works without manual blackboard and still replays.

Tripwires
	•	If a parser would touch secrets or destructive choices → force Clarify instead.

⸻

Milestone 7 — Local registry + mining + CI harness (7–10 days)

Scope
	•	SQLite registry storing manifests (id@version, states).
	•	Deterministic miner (PrefixSpan) over last N traces → candidate manifests.
	•	Compiler: fill signature, preconditions from shapes; plan from steps; activation from labels/keywords; budget from p95.
	•	CI harness: generate unit + fuzz tests; block activation if thresholds unmet.

Demo
	•	Run a set of traces; learn_snapshot() yields candidate skill; run registry.test_activate(id); skill becomes active locally.

Tests
	•	Miner support threshold respected; CI failures block activation.
	•	Eviction: if failure streak > 2 or usage <5/wk, mark deprecated.

Exit criteria
	•	You can learn a simple skill from traces and activate it confidently.

Tripwires
	•	No org sharing; keep it per-project. No non-contiguous sequences.

⸻

Milestone 8 — Framework adapters (LangGraph, LangChain) (5–7 days)

Scope
	•	wrap_langgraph: inject bulletin before first model node; process replies after model nodes; checkpoint on skill execution.
	•	wrap_langchain: callback handler injects bulletin on first on_llm_start; processes on on_llm_end.

Demo
	•	Same demos as earlier but with the frameworks’ native entrypoints; zero agent code changes.

Tests
	•	Invariant: exactly one bulletin injection per turn.
	•	Proposals parsed even with interleaved tools and multiple model steps.

Exit criteria
	•	One-liner works in real frameworks; logs still single trace_id.

⸻

(Optional) Milestone 9 — Control-plane client (2–4 days)

Scope
	•	Implement /policy/check, /skills/sync, /promotions, /telemetry clients with offline cache.
	•	Policy is advisory by default; enforce if policy_mode="enforce".

Exit criteria
	•	When offline, SDK still works; when online, we see policy denies logged.

⸻

What you’ll see at each step (UX you can manually verify)
	•	M0: “Reflex skeleton injected” appears once; logs have a single trace_id.
	•	M1: <SKILL_RESULT> shows up in conversation even though nothing ran.
	•	M2: Proposals accepted/rejected with reasons (compat, preconds).
	•	M3: A file is actually edited; running twice doesn’t duplicate work (idempotence).
	•	M4: Changing τ changes eagerness; missing slots triggers a crisp Clarify.
	•	M5: Budget breach triggers compensation; replay equals original.
	•	M6: No blackboard passed; seeding works; replay uses snapshot.
	•	M7: learn_snapshot produces a manifest; CI passes; skill is active.
	•	M8: One-liner works in LangGraph/LC; still deterministic.

⸻

Developer checklists (copy into PR templates)

General PR
	•	Adds one concept only.
	•	Replay parity kept for golden traces.
	•	New logs documented in docs/events.md.

Gate change
	•	Compat → Precond → Score → Policy order preserved.
	•	New score weight monotonic, logged separately.
	•	Unit tests explain rejection reasons.

Plan change
	•	Idempotence key present for side-effects.
	•	Budget enforced; compensation covers partial failure paths.
	•	Step guards tested.

Parser
	•	Temperature = 0; prompt pinned; unit tests pass.
	•	No secrets inferred; falls back to Clarify.

Adapter
	•	Exactly one bulletin injection per turn.
	•	Proposals parsed with interleaved tools.
	•	Does not change user messages beyond bulletin and results.

⸻

Metrics to watch from day 1
	•	Precision@1 for gate (how often the first eligible skill succeeds).
	•	Clarify rate (should be high initially; declines as configs/parsers improve).
	•	Δcost / Δp95 when a skill is used vs baseline.
	•	Failure streaks per skill (auto-deprecrate threshold).
	•	Replay parity (must be 100% on goldens).

⸻

“You are here” CLI (keep you aware in dev)
	•	reflex trace show <trace_id> → render decisions, scores, preconditions, policy.
	•	reflex replay <trace_id> → run and diff.
	•	reflex learn snapshot --window 2000 → mine & list candidates.
	•	reflex skill test <id> → run unit+fuzz locally.
	•	reflex skill activate <id>@<ver> → set active.
	•	reflex bulletin preview --bb blackboard.json → show the next turn’s Skill Cards.

⸻

Stop rules (avoid over-engineering)
	•	If replay parity breaks, stop adding features and fix.
	•	If Skill Cards exceed K=5 or >600 tokens total, stop and prune.
	•	If preconditions require network I/O, move the check inside the plan or a tool; don’t bloat the Gate.
	•	If a feature requires a second LLM or training job, mark out-of-scope V1.

⸻

Minimal fixtures you can implement first
	•	Fake tools: fs.read/write/patch, term.exec (echo only), tests.run (mock pass/fail).
	•	Two sample manifests: ensure_header, format_markdown.
	•	Two sample parsers: extract title from text; extract env from a stub config.
	•	Tiny agent: while loop that prints replies; Reflex will do the rest.

⸻

Bottom line

Build from the wrapper outward, prove awareness with the ASP, add the Gate, then execute tiny, safe plans. Only when replay is perfect do you add budgets, parsers, registry, and adapters. Each milestone is demoable, logged, and individually testable—so you never lose the plot or end up with a clever but unshippable tangle.
